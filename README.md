# sela-mf-workshop

Repository for the workshop regarding Micro Frontends at Sela.

Structure:

- **demos**: Contains all the demos referenced in the theory parts.
- **exercises**: Contains information and boilerplate code to be used for doing the exercises.
- **solutions**: Contains solution proposals for the different exercises.

Make sure to run `npm i` in each folder containing a *package.json*.

Some demos / examples / solutions have a *run-all.sh* file. This works in WSL, Linux, and MacOS. Running the script via `./run-all.sh` will actually install and run everything necessary for the respective demo / example / solution.
