# Exercise 6

Write a pilet to integrate customer reviews in the tractor webshop. Publish the pilet into your feed.

Questions:

* How can your pilet(s) be combined with some base pilets?
* How is your pilet integrated in the solution?

Hints:

* Use the `purple` directory as a starting point to develop (it already contains a *package.json* and a script file).
* Extend the `src/index.jsx` etc. to have the desired functionality.
* Run the new MF by calling `npm start` in the `purple` directory (don't forget to `npm install` first).
