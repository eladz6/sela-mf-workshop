# Exercise 3

Write another MF for the webshop using web components. The MF should show reviews related to the currently selected product.

Questions:

* How can the new MF be integrated?
* How is the MF being debugged?

Hints:

* Use the `purple` directory as a starting point to develop (it already contains a *package.json* and a script file).
* Extend the `src/product-reviews.js` to have the desired functionality.
* Run the new MF by calling `npm start` in the `purple` directory (don't forget to `npm install` first).
* Run the original demo from the `demos/demo-02` folder via `run-all.sh`.
