# Exercise 5

Create a React web application to be bundled by Webpack. Share some dependencies such `react` and `react-dom` via Module Federation.

Include the consent dialog MF from the "consent" directory in the application.

-> Container is `consent` at script `consent/index.js`
-> Exposes `./dialog`
-> Exports function `showDialog`

Questions:

* What version of React is the consent MF using?
* What if the sharing of React is turned off?

Hint:

* Use the "app" directory as a starting point.
